## Your Goal: Find the Longer Half
Let's find the longer half of the string before and after the `x`!

1. First, you'll need to find the **lower-case** `x`.
2. Once you've found the `x`, split the string in half. The first half will be the string before the `x`, the second half will be the string after the `x`.
3. Take the **longer** string and return it!
